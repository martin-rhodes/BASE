BASE

Batch Audio Stream Encoder

BASE allows you to batch encode a large variety of video file formats into their audio equivalent using the power of 
VLC. Its main strength lies in its ability to scan folders for target video file types, and then recreate the 
folder structure of the discovered source material using a custom output folder and bitrate.
                        

This is particularly useful when encoding structured material (such as eLearning courses), as the original folder 
structure remains intact, allowing you to listen to the course material in the same order as it is presented within 
the videos.

BASE is a C#.NET project built in Visual Studio 2012 and can be compiled and run on all platofrms that support 
C#.NET.
